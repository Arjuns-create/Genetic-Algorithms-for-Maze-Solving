# Genetic-Algorithms-for-Maze-Solving

Overview

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for solving maze navigation problems. GAs are a type of evolutionary algorithm inspired by natural selection, which mimic the process of evolution to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems. Here, the objective is to evolve a population of solutions (paths) to navigate through a maze efficiently, avoiding obstacles and finding the shortest or most efficient route from a starting point to an end goal.
